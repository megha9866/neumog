# Neumog Product Story

## One-Sentence Positioning

Neumog builds and runs digital products using a hybrid model: a tight internal leadership core plus a vetted network of senior freelancers and, soon, RLHF/data-annotation experts.

## Core Proof Points

- **End-to-end accountability**: strategy, design, build, launch, and run—not single tickets.
- **Hybrid delivery model**: internal product, delivery, and architecture leads orchestrate specialist freelancers from MNCs/product orgs.
- **Industry focus**: e-commerce, hospitality, food/grocery delivery, local service marketplaces, plus near-future RLHF & data annotation programs.
- **Managed partner, not a gig marketplace**: curated teams, shared rituals, SLAs, and platform visibility distinguish Neumog from Upwork/Fiverr-style marketplaces.
